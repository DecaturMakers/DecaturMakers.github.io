Move approve for $21,800 expenditures to repair/replace roof

Action recommended by facilities chair Greg Coleson.

The Tectum people took a few days to get their estimate back to Bill Duty so he was delayed in getting it to us.

The estimate came in at $21,800 to replace the first row of Tectum on each side deck the whole roof, gutters, wood fixing and painting.

I say lets go for it before we get any more behind.  The Tectum for our application is a special order and takes 10 days.
