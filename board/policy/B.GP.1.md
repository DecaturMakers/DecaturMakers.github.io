# Board Policy
## {{ page.title }}

The board will govern lawfully, with an emphasis on:

1. outward vision rather than an internal preoccupation
2. encouragement of diversity in viewpoints
3. strategic leadership more than administrative detail
4. clear distinction of board and chief executive roles
5. collective rather than individual decisions
6. future rather than past or present
7. proactivity rather than reactivity
