Action recommended by Garrett Goebel

Summary: The purpose of adopting these policies to provide just enough of a policy framework to allow adoption of the *B.GP.6.2 Conflict of Interest* policy provided by Marc Wisniewski in order to comply with 501(c)3 requirements.

The policies which follow are largely drawn from *Reinventing Your Board* by John and Miriam Carver with influence from prior board policy drafts, the [UUA Governance Manual](http://www.uua.org/uuagovernance/manual/limits/index.shtml), and with an emphasis on the subset related to Governance Process.

### B.E.0 - Global Ends

The purpose of Decatur Makers, Inc. is to provide space and resources for the community to build, share, and explore at a reasonable cost.

### B.BMD.0 - Global Board Management Delegation

The board's sole official connection to the operational organization, its achievements and conduct will be through a chief executive officer, titled Executive Director.

### B.EL.0 - Global Executive Limitations

The Executive Director as chief executive officer shall not cause or allow any organizational practice, activity, decision, or circumstance that is either unlawful, imprudent, or in violation of commonly accepted business and professional ethics and practices.

### B.GP.0 - Global Governance Process

The purpose of the board, on behalf of the Sources of Authority and Accountability, is to see to it that Decatur Makers, Inc.

1. achieves appropriate results for appropriate persons at an appropriate cost (as specified by board Ends policies)
2. avoids unacceptable actions and situations (as prohibited in board Executive Limitations policies)

Our Sources of Authority and Accountability are defined as:

1. Our current and future members
2. The greater Decatur area community

### B.GP.1 - Governing Style

The board will govern lawfully, with an emphasis on:

1. outward vision rather than an internal preoccupation
2. encouragement of diversity in viewpoints
3. strategic leadership more than administrative detail
4. clear distinction of board and chief executive roles
5. collective rather than individual decisions
6. future rather than past or present
7. proactivity rather than reactivity

### B.GP.2 - Board Job Description

The specific job outputs of the board, as an informed and elected leaders of our membership, are those which assure organizational performance in accord with established board policy.

### B.GP.3 - Agenda Planning

To accomplish its job products with a governance style consistent with board policies, the board will follow an annual agenda that:

1. completes a re-exploration of Ends policies annually
2. continually improves board performance through board education and enriched input and deliberation

### B.GP.4 - Board President's Role

The Board President, acting as Chief Governing Officer is a specifically empowered member of the board, whose role is to assure the integrity of the board's process and secondarily, occasionally represents the board to outside parties.

### B.GP.5 - Board Secretary's Role

The board secretary is an officer of the board whose purpose is to ensure the integrity of the board's documents.

### B.GP.6 - Board Members' Code of Conduct

The board commits itself and its members to ethical, businesslike, and lawful conduct, including proper use of authority and appropriate decorum when acting as board members.

### B.GP.6.1 - Loyalty

Members must have loyalty to the Sources of Authority and Accountability, unconflicted by loyalties to staff, other organizations, and any personal interest as a consumer of the space and resources.

### B.GP.6.2 - Conflict of Interest

Members must avoid conflict of interest with respect to their fiduciary responsibility.

## Article I

### Purpose

The purpose of the conflict of interest policy is to protect Decatur Makers' interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of an officer or director of Decatur Makers or might result in a possible excess benefit transaction. This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable organizations.

## Article II

### Definitions
1. Interested Person: Any director, principal officer, or member of a committee with governing board delegated powers, who has a direct or indirect financial interest, as defined below, is an interested person.
2. Financial Interest: A person has a financial interest if the person has, directly or indirectly, through business, investment, or family:
    1. An ownership or investment interest in any entity with which Decatur Makers has a transaction or arrangement,
    2. A compensation arrangement with Decatur Makers or with any entity or individual with which Decatur Makers has a transaction or arrangement, or
    3. A potential ownership or investment interest in, or compensation arrangement with, any entity or individual with which Decatur Makers is negotiating a transaction or arrangement.

Compensation includes direct and indirect remuneration as well as gifts or favors that are not insubstantial. A financial interest is not necessarily a conflict of interest. Under Article III, Section 2, a person who has a financial interest may have a conflict of interest only if the appropriate governing board or committee decides that a conflict of interest exists.

## Article III

### Procedures

1. Duty to Disclose: In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors and members of committees with governing board delegated powers considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.
2. Determining Whether a Conflict of Interest Exists: After disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the interested person, he/she shall leave the governing board or committee meeting while the determination of a conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining board or committee members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.
3. Procedures for Addressing the Conflict of Interest:
    1. An interested person may make a presentation at the governing board or committee meeting, but after the presentation, he/she shall leave the meeting during the discussion of, and the vote on, the transaction or arrangement involving the possible conflict of interest.
    2. The chairperson of the governing board or committee shall, if appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement.
    3. After exercising due diligence, the governing board or committee shall determine whether Decatur Makers can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.
    4. If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the governing board or committee shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in Decatur Makers' best interest, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. In conformity with the above determination it shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction or arrangement.
4. Violations of the Conflicts of Interest Policy
    1. If the governing board or committee has reasonable cause to believe a member has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, it shall inform the member of the basis for such belief and afford the member an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
    2. If, after hearing the member's response and after making further investigation as warranted by the circumstances, the governing board or committee determines the member has failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.

## Article IV

### Records of Proceedings

The minutes of the governing board and all committees with board delegated powers shall contain:

1. The names of the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine whether a  conflict of interest was present, and the governing board's or committee's decision as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed.

2. The names of the persons who were present for discussions and votes relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussion, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any votes taken in connection with the proceedings.

# Article V

## Compensation

1. A voting member of the governing board who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from Decatur Makers for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member's compensation.
2. A voting member of any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from Decatur Makers for services is precluded from voting on matters pertaining to that member's compensation.
3. No voting member of the governing board or any committee whose jurisdiction includes compensation matters and who receives compensation, directly or indirectly, from Decatur Makers, either individually or collectively, is prohibited from providing information to any committee regarding compensation.

## Article VI

### Annual Statements

Each director, principal officer and member of a committee with governing board delegated powers shall annually sign a statement which affirms such person:

1. Has received a copy of the conflicts of interest policy,
2. Has read and understands the policy,
3. Has agreed to comply with the policy, and
4. Understands Decatur Makers is charitable and in order to maintain its federal tax exemption it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.

## Article VII

### Periodic Reviews

To ensure Decatur Makers operates in a manner consistent with charitable purposes and does not engage in activities that could jeopardize its tax-exempt status, periodic reviews shall be conducted. The periodic reviews shall, at a minimum, include the following subjects:

1. Whether compensation arrangements and benefits are reasonable, based on competent survey information, and the result of arm's length bargaining.
2. Whether partnerships, joint ventures, and arrangements with management organizations conform to Decatur Makers' written policies, are properly recorded, reflect reasonable investment or payments for goods and services, further charitable purposes and do not result in inurement, impermissible private benefit or in an excess benefit transaction.

## Article VIII

### Use of Outside Experts

When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article VII, Decatur Makers may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts are used, their use shall not relieve the governing board of its responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are conducted.

### B.GP.6.3 - No Individual Authority

Board members may not attempt to exercise individual authority over the organization

### B.GP.6.4 - Confidentiality

Members will respect the confidentiality appropriate to issues of a sensitive nature.

### B.GP.6.5 - Preparation

Members will be properly prepared for board deliberation.

### B.GP.6.6 - Legitimacy and Authority of Board Determinations

Members will support the legitimacy and authority of the final determination of the board on any matter, irrespective of the member's personal position on the issue.
