Present: Lew Lefton, Garrett Goebel, Caitlin Dooley, Marc Wisniewski, and Kris 

Garrett called the meeting to order and read the organizational resolutions of incorporation for Decatur Makers, Inc.

### Changes to original by-laws:
*   Change of make-up of Board from 7 to 5
*   Change of name to &ldquo;Makers&rdquo; (rather than Space)
*   Separate Chair and CEO

Garrett passed Presidency on to Lew. 

### Officers named:
*   President: Lew
*   Vice-president: Garrett
*   Secretary: Caitlin
*   Treasurer and CFO: Marc
*   Board member at large: Gail

(eventually there will be a President, Past-president, President-elect; possibly with involvement of Decatur Education Foundation)

Lew convened initial Board for 1-year term, or until an annual meeting. Marc suggests that we review the by-law that suggests that a term could be less than a year. 

Ballard Spahr will provide legal services. They will not charge legal fees; all work pro-bono. Articles of Incorporation and By-laws have been approved. We will want to spend time each meeting to review a part of the by-laws to ensure that we&rsquo;re all comfortable with the language of the by-laws.

Term limits need to be reviewed.

Lew will start a GoogleDrive to store all legal documents.

### Committee Reports:
*   Garrett reported about bank account status. Around $1400 in bank ($1500 of expenses on sign, etc.; registration fees for faires still need to be reimbursed to Garrett)
*   Tax refund would be available after 501.3c status.
*   Until DM gets 501.3c status, charitable gifts can be given to the Decatur Foundation.
*   Update on potential grants was given:
    *   Beer festival grant (Lew to submit)
    *   DeKalb County grant (Caitlin to investigate)
    *   William T. Grant (Caitlin investigated and will not apply)
    *   Decatur Education Foundation can assist with applications to granting organizations.
    *   Countess Moira (sp?) grant (Caitlin to investigate)
    *   Lew suggests that fund-raising committee may need to be established via Finance Committee
    *   Lew gave an update on the funding agreement status (fiscal agreement); Honda and Toyota grants will be sought by the Decatur Education Foundation because they have 2 years experience (pending 10% indirect cost rate)
    *   Lew was contacted by Kimberly Varney (Dir of Atlanta Mini-maker Faire). She was contacted by John Bare (Blank Family Foundation) looking to connect with local community makers. Lew to follow up.
    *   Lew circulated draft of sample revenue sheet (discussion about whether CSD kids would have no cost)
    *   Need to fund-raise via Kickstarter and/or Indie-gogo

*   Facilities/Space
    *   Two potential top candidates:
        *   Hillyer &amp; E. Howard (behind Felini&rsquo;s)&mdash;to be shown next Wed.; lot next door is being looked at by developer; developer may give to DM (possibly 4,000 sq. ft.)
        *   First Christian Church gym&mdash;donated 2-3,000 sq. ft. space; needs restoration; up-keep may be an issue (possibly $15,000-$30,000)
    *   Other possible options:

        *   Avondale downtown&mdash;owned by the Mayor
        *   Atlanta hot glass&mdash;unicorp. DeKalb; possible issue: Decatur Ed Foundation may not be as interested in partnering if not City of Decatur
